    <h2>What is Cricket</h2>
    <p>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players. One team bats 
      to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields to stop them. Players score runs by 
      hitting the ball and running between the wickets, or by hitting boundaries. There are three 
      main formats of cricket: Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20). You can read more about this using the link below.

    <h3>Test Cricket</h3>
    <p>
      Test cricket is the longest and oldest format of the game. It is played between two national teams over five days, with each team batting twice (two innings). The format tests a team's skill and strategy. Unlike shorter formats like T20 or One Day Internationals, Test matches can end in a win, loss, draw, or tie. The matches are played using a red ball, and players wear white uniforms. Test cricket is considered the ultimate test of a cricketer's ability.

    <h2>One Day Cricket</h2>
    <p>
      ODI stands for One Day International, a limited-overs format of cricket played between two national teams. In an ODI match, each team gets to bat for a maximum of 50 overs. The team that scores more runs wins the game. Unlike Test matches, which last up to five days, ODIs are completed in a single day and are known for being more fast-paced and exciting. ODI cricket uses a white ball, and players wear colored uniforms. This format is used in major tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup, and it combines strategy, skill, and entertainment, making it one of the most popular formats in international cricket.

    <h2>T20 Cricket</h2>
    <p>
      T20 cricket, also known as Twenty20 cricket, is the shortest official format of the game. Each team gets to bat for a maximum of 20 overs, making the match last about three hours. T20 matches are known for their fast pace, big hitting, and high energy. This format is especially popular with younger audiences and is often played under floodlights in stadiums with lively crowds. Players wear colored uniforms, and the matches are played with a white ball. T20 cricket is used in international competitions as well as popular leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL).
